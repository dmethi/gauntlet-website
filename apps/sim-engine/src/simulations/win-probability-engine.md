# Lightweight Win Probability Engine

**Status:** Research Complete, Implementation Pending  
**Purpose:** Real-time fantasy matchup win probability for pre-game odds and live game updates  
**Approach:** Data-driven Monte Carlo simulation using historical variance constants

## 🎯 Core Concept

Build a **lightweight simulation layer** to power live win probability estimates during game days for fantasy matchups using:

- **Pregame projections** (with data-driven variance distributions)
- **Current fantasy scores** (actual points accumulated)
- **Game context** (% of game completed, drives remaining)
- **Updated projections** based on game progress decay

### Key Insight
We're **not simulating from scratch** each time — we're taking pre-existing projections, applying a **decay function** based on game context, and using that to estimate expected final scores and confidence intervals.

## 📊 Historical Data Findings

### Sleeper API Coverage (2015-2024)
✅ **10 full seasons** of historical data available  
✅ **Both stats AND projections** for every season  
✅ **~1,500-2,500 players** with weekly stats per season  
✅ **~8,600 players** with projections (includes benchwarmers)

### Derived Position Variance Constants
*Based on 3 recent seasons (2022-2024) with high confidence sample sizes:*

| Position | Coefficient of Variation | Avg Points | Sample Size | Confidence Level |
|----------|-------------------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **K** (Kickers) | **0.50** | 7.2 pts | 282 | High |
| **QB** | **0.80** | 38.3 pts | 637 | High |
| **TE** | **0.99** | 5.0 pts | 1,458 | High |
| **RB** | **0.98** | 7.0 pts | 684 | High |
| **WR** | **0.98** | 8.9 pts | 115 | High |
| **DEF** | **0.75** | ~8.0 pts | *Estimated* | Medium |

### Key Insights
1. **Kickers are most predictable** (50% variance) - consistent volume, limited upside
2. **QBs have moderate variance** (80%) - consistent volume but game script dependent  
3. **Skill positions are highly volatile** (~98%) - boom/bust nature of targets/touches
4. **Sample sizes are robust** - all positions have 100+ samples for statistical confidence

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

### 1. Pre-Game Simulation
```typescript
interface PreGameSimulation {
  input: {
    team1Projections: PlayerProjection[];
    team2Projections: PlayerProjection[];
    iterations: number; // Default: 1000
  };
  
  output: {
    team1WinPct: number;
    team2WinPct: number;
    expectedScores: { team1: number; team2: number };
    confidenceInterval: { team1: [number, number]; team2: [number, number] };
  };
}
```

### 2. Live Game Simulation
```typescript
interface LiveGameSimulation {
  input: {
    team1Players: PlayerState[]; // projection + actual points
    team2Players: PlayerState[]; // projection + actual points
    gameProgress: number; // 0-1 (0 = not started, 1 = complete)
    iterations: number;
  };
  
  output: {
    // Same as pre-game + metadata
    metadata: {
      gameProgress: number;
      timestamp: string;
      remainingProjections: { team1: number; team2: number };
    };
  };
}
```

## 🧮 Simulation Algorithm

### Core Logic Flow
```typescript
for each simulation iteration:
  for each player:
    if gameProgress >= 1:
      use actualPoints
    else:
      // Calculate remaining projection
      remainingProjection = originalProjection * decay(gameProgress)
      totalProjection = actualPoints + remainingProjection
      
      // Add position-based variance
      finalProjection = addVariance(totalProjection, player.position)
    
    teamScore += finalProjection
  
  compare team1Score vs team2Score → record winner
  
return win%, expectedScores, confidenceIntervals
```

### Game Progress Decay Functions
```typescript
// Linear decay (simple)
remainingMultiplier = 1 - gameProgress

// Conservative decay (slower early, faster late)  
remainingMultiplier = 1 - Math.pow(gameProgress, 1.5)

// Example: 50% game complete
// Linear: 50% of original projection remains
// Conservative: 65% of original projection remains
```

### Variance Application
```typescript
function addVarianceToProjection(projection: number, position: Position): number {
  const variance = POSITION_VARIANCE[position];
  
  // Box-Muller normal distribution
  const randomFactor = generateNormalRandom();
  
  // Apply variance: projection ± (variance * projection * randomFactor)
  const noisyProjection = projection + (projection * variance * randomFactor);
  
  return Math.max(0, noisyProjection);
}
```

## 📡 Data Sources Required

### Immediate (MVP)
1. **Sleeper projections** - Weekly player projections (already available)
2. **Sleeper live scoring** - Real-time fantasy points during games
3. **Game clock/status** - Current quarter, time remaining, game completion %
   - Sources: ESPN API (free), Sleeper game endpoints, Yahoo Sports API

### Nice to Have (V2)
1. **Enhanced game context** - Drive count, snap percentages, red zone attempts
2. **Weather data** - For outdoor games affecting kickers/passing
3. **Vegas lines** - Implied totals for game script context

## 🔧 Implementation Scaffolding

### Position Variance Constants (Ready to Use)
```typescript
const POSITION_VARIANCE = {
  QB: 0.80,   // From 637 historical performances
  RB: 0.98,   // From 684 historical performances  
  WR: 0.98,   // From 115 historical performances
  TE: 0.99,   // From 1,458 historical performances
  K: 0.50,    // From 282 historical performances
  DEF: 0.75   // Estimated based on defensive scoring patterns
} as const;
```

### Core Function Signatures
```typescript
// Pre-game simulation
function simulatePreGameOdds(
  team1: TeamProjection,
  team2: TeamProjection,
  iterations: number = 1000
): WinProbabilityResult;

// Live game simulation  
function simulateLiveWinProbability(
  team1: TeamProjection,
  team2: TeamProjection,
  gameProgress: number,
  iterations: number = 1000
): WinProbabilityResult;

// Game progress decay
function calculateRemainingProjection(
  originalProjection: number,
  actualPoints: number,
  gameProgress: number,
  decayFunction: 'linear' | 'conservative' = 'linear'
): number;
```

### Example Usage Patterns
```typescript
// Pre-game odds for weekly matchup preview
const preGameOdds = simulatePreGameOdds(teamAlpha, teamBeta, 5000);
console.log(`Team Alpha favored by ${preGameOdds.expectedScores.team1 - preGameOdds.expectedScores.team2} points`);

// Live updates during Sunday games (run every 5 minutes)
const liveOdds = simulateLiveWinProbability(teamAlpha, teamBeta, 0.65, 1000);
console.log(`Win probability has shifted to ${liveOdds.team1WinPct}% after 65% game completion`);
```

4. **Variance validation** - Confirm confidence intervals contain actual results appropriately

### Sample Testing Data Available
- **3 seasons** of detailed stats/projections (2022-2024) in `docs/sleeper-api/historical-testing/`
- **10 seasons** of availability confirmed (2015-2024)
- **20,000+ player performances** across all positions for robust testing

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Accuracy
- **Win probability calibration**: 60% predictions should win ~60% of time
- **Score projection MAE**: <15 points average error for team totals
- **Confidence interval coverage**: 80% CI should contain actual results 80% of time

### User Engagement
- **Pre-game usage**: % of users viewing matchup odds before games
